<h1>Scrum driven cybersecurity: Leading teams, Protecting data</h1>

## Introduction:

<p>My name is Clifford Jules, and I bring a unique blend of experience from the trucking industry, where I specialized in delivering loads between Canada and the USA, specifically in the flatbed sector. The responsibility of ensuring secure and efficient transportation of goods has naturally evolved into a deep interest in cybersecurity, where I see a strong parallel in protecting and securing valuable assets.

My experience in logistics management has instilled in me meticulous attention to detail, discipline, and problem-solving skills—traits that are essential in cybersecurity. I am genuinely passionate about this field because it offers the opportunity to apply these strengths in a new and impactful way. My goal is to leverage this background to help organizations meet their security goals by safeguarding their digital assets against emerging threats.

In addition to my logistics background, I have studied project management with a focus on Scrum, where I successfully guided teams through Scrum events to deliver high-quality, releasable increments. This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in managing projects that require both security and agility. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by studying for the CCNA and CompTIA Security+ certifications. These certifications will equip me with the technical knowledge necessary to contribute effectively to cybersecurity teams, ensuring that I can play a pivotal role in meeting an organization’s security objectives while maintaining operational efficiency.

As I continue to grow and develop in this field, I am committed to regularly updating my skills and knowledge to stay ahead of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. My mission is to bring my unique background and passion for security to bear in protecting the digital assets of the organizations I work with, aligning my career goals with the critical security needs of the industry.
